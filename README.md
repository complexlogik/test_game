# test_game

-Make a one page game using javascript, html, css and maybe ruby, maybe unity? We will have to discuss

-Needs:
  *storyline?
  *pagelayot
  *wireframe
  *team + team roles + assignments
  *timeframe

-idea
  a boardgame(may have a 3d element of climbing up and down? and have a more then one floor? basically start with money and a lvl 1 piece move around the board(using 2 movement dice -- amount of dice subject to change) fight "wild things" and lvl up and potentially get abilities to use? 
  
  -you could gamble for abilities as well? instead of earning the base move depending on roll you get nothing?
   *an idea for the story would be something to deal with pokemon(but darker? where in order to get moves and level up you consume other"pokemon"?
